Deployed version of the app can be found here: https://ipaddress-map.herokuapp.com/ (note that 'unsafe' scripts must be loaded in order for the app to load properly')

A default ip addres of '175.156.41.10' has been placed in the input textbox to test out its functionality. Select the submit button after scripts are loaded.
